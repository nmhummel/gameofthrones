WELCOME TO WESTEROS!
Winter is Coming, but if you hated the final season of the TV show, you would know that Winter has come, wreaked havoc, and left without a goodbye.

Description:
This program assumes you are familiar with Game of Thrones. If not, you can still have fun. Pretend you've just arrived in the main world of Game of Thrones-- Westeros. As your host, I will introduce you to the top houses/families of each region. Learn about their mottos, the royal seats they hold, and more. This information may come in handy if you decide to go for the crown yourself. 


TO GET STARTED:
In your terminal, make sure you are in the project's main directory. 
Enter 'bundle install' to get the tools you'll need to run this application properly.
Once that is complete, enter 'ruby bin/start' into terminal and let the program do all the work.

WELCOME TO WESTEROS!
Winter is Coming, but if you hated the final season of the TV show, you would know that Winter has come, wreaked havoc, and left without a goodbye.

Description:
This program assumes you are familiar with Game of Thrones. If not, you can still have fun. Pretend you've just arrived in the main world of Game of Thrones-- Westeros. As your host, I will introduce you to the top houses/families of each region. Learn about their mottos, the royal seats they hold, and more. This information may come in handy if you decide to go for the crown yourself. 


TO GET STARTED:
In your terminal, make sure you are in the project's main directory. 
Enter 'bundle install' to get the tools you'll need to run this application properly.
Once that is complete, enter 'ruby bin/start' into terminal and let the program do all the work.

This is my first ever project for Flatiron School. I don't expect this to grow into an internet sensation. If you want to add to it, just email me at natalie.hummel@gmail.com and let me know. 








Ruby Essentials *
Basic control flow - how "if" statements work
Variable scopes - method, instance and class
Object instantiation - #new (and possibly #initialize)
The meaning of the "self" keyword
Method types - class vs. instance methods
Method return types - knowing what methods return
Iterating through collections - at least using #each with a block




Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
